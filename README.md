# ðŸŒ€ Spring Batch REST Job

This Spring Boot + Spring Batch project reads customer data from a database in chunks and sends it to a REST API. It includes:

- âœ… Scheduled job execution
- âœ… Chunk-based processing
- âœ… Retry on failure (`RetryTemplate`)
- âœ… Fallback to file + DB logging
- âœ… Email notifications for failed items
- âœ… Job auditing with `StepExecutionListener`
